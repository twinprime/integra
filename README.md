# Integra

A visual editor for system engineering models using diagram specifications.

---

## For Users

### Quick Start

#### 1. Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

#### 2. Save and load your model

Use the **Save** / **Load** buttons in the toolbar to persist your model as a **directory of YAML files** via the browser's File System Access API. Each component is saved as its own `.yaml` file inside a chosen directory. Changes are also auto-saved to `localStorage` and restored on page load.

> **Browser support:** Save/Load requires Chrome or Edge (File System Access API). Firefox and Safari are not supported.

#### 3. Build your system model

The left panel shows your **system tree**. Start by clicking the **Integra** icon
to switch from the default **browse mode** into **edit mode**, then rename the
root component and add sub-components, use case diagrams, and sequence diagrams
using the **+** buttons on each node. When you select a node, the right panel
lets you edit its title inline at the top of the panel and shows its absolute
path directly underneath; the final segment remains the editable node ID, while
earlier segments are clickable breadcrumbs back into the tree.

#### 4. Write diagram specifications

Select a diagram node to open its specification editor. Type your spec in the text area — the right panel renders the diagram in real time. Syntax is highlighted as you type.

#### 5. Explore the derived model

As you write sequence diagrams, Integra automatically derives:
- **Actors and components** added to the owning component
- **Interface specifications** (with typed functions and parameters) on the receiving component
- **Use cases** listed under their use case diagram
- **Visualization panel view switcher** — node types can expose multiple renderable diagram views in the bottom panel; the panel shows a switcher when more than one view is available and resets to that node type's default view when you change tree selection
- **Generated class diagrams** — root, component, use-case-diagram, and use-case views now follow the same generation rules:
  - Input comes from all sequence diagrams owned under the selected node's owner boundary plus all transitively referenced `Sequence:`, `UseCase:`, and `UseCaseDiagram:` targets
  - Visible participants are limited to actors owned by visible components plus components that are direct children of the owner component, components that are in README **Reference Scope** for that owner component, and the selected component itself when the selected node is a component
  - Interfaces are shown only for visible components that participate in at least one derived dependency; if a visible component interface is used, only the called methods are listed, otherwise the full interface is shown
  - Dependencies to or from out-of-scope descendants are folded up to the closest ancestor component that is still visible in scope
  - The shared **Interfaces** toggle hides interface nodes and collapses interface-derived dependencies into direct component-to-component links while preserving separate opposite-direction dependencies
  - In component class diagrams, the selected component and its interfaces are styled as the default subject
  - Single-click a class node to focus/filter the diagram to that component, its interfaces, and directly linked classes; single-click it again to clear the filter; double-click to navigate to the node in the tree

Navigate the tree to inspect generated nodes. On initial load, only the root node starts expanded; descendants stay collapsed until you expand them or selection/navigation auto-reveals them. In generated class diagrams, single-clicking a class focuses the diagram around that component; double-clicking navigates to that node in the tree. Hovering a dependency link shows the dependency source and target names plus the sequence diagrams that derived that dependency; clicking a multi-source dependency keeps that popup available for selection, while clicking a single-source dependency navigates directly to that sequence diagram. Hovering an implementation link shows the component and interface names for that relationship, and clicking it pins the popup for inspection. Orphaned nodes (no longer referenced by any diagram) show a delete button on hover.

### Editor Features

#### Autocomplete

The diagram spec editor provides context-aware suggestions as you type:
- **Participants**: suggest known actors and components when typing after `actor`, `component`, or `from`; descendants of the owning component are suggested with a **relative path** (e.g. `grandchild` or `child/grandchild`), while cross-tree references use an **absolute path** with an alias (e.g. `root/services/auth as auth`)
- **Message receivers**: suggest participants when typing the receiver in a message line
- **UseCase targets**: suggest use case IDs after `UseCase:` in a message label; for use cases in other components the suggestion includes the full path (e.g. `UseCase:orders/placeOrder`)
- **UseCaseDiagram targets**: suggest use case diagram IDs after `UseCaseDiagram:` in a message label; for diagrams in other components the suggestion includes the full path

Suggestions appear automatically as you type. They reflect nodes already defined in the current component (local-first ordering). Accept with `Enter`, dismiss with `Escape`.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Shift+Enter` | Save spec and preview diagram without leaving edit mode |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` | Undo in the diagram spec editor (CodeMirror history) *or* tree-level |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd/Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Alt+←` | Navigate back to the previously selected tree node |
| `Alt+→` | Navigate forward (after going back) |

Tree-level undo/redo is also accessible via the toolbar buttons above the system tree.
The diagram spec editor uses CodeMirror's built-in history, fully independent from the tree-level history.

#### Node Navigation History

The toolbar above the system tree includes **← Back** and **→ Forward** buttons (before Undo/Redo). These work like browser navigation — clicking any node in the tree adds it to the history, and you can step backwards and forwards through your recent selections. The history is per-session and is not persisted across page reloads.

When navigation happens from a rendered diagram or a markdown node link, the
tree automatically expands the newly selected node's ancestor chain and scrolls
that node into view.

#### Description editing

Node descriptions open in a **preview-first** mode. The selected node shows its
rendered markdown immediately, without a separate description label or markdown
toolbar. Click the description area to switch into the full markdown editor;
when the description is empty, the preview shows a compact **No Description**
placeholder until you enter edit mode. In **browse mode**, empty description
sections are hidden instead of showing the placeholder.

#### Browse mode

Integra restores the last used mode from `localStorage` and defaults to
**browse mode** on first load. Click the **Integra** icon in the tree toolbar
to toggle between browse and edit mode; the icon is decorated while edit mode
is active.

In browse mode:
- visible fields stay readable but become non-editable
- empty description sections are hidden across nodes, interfaces, and functions
- diagram specification editor fields are hidden so the visualization panel can use the freed space
- tree mutation affordances such as add/delete/reorder controls are hidden
- the **Undo**, **Redo**, **Save**, and **Clear** toolbar buttons are hidden

#### TODO comments

Nodes can expose a derived TODO list in the tree.

- Add a TODO in description markdown with an HTML comment:
  `<!-- TODO review naming -->`
- Add a TODO in diagram text with a line comment:
  `# TODO review naming`

Each node's TODO indicator aggregates TODOs defined on that node plus all of its
descendants. Clicking the indicator opens a flat list showing each TODO and the
node where it is defined; clicking a TODO navigates to that source node in the
tree. TODOs are derived at runtime and are not saved with the model.

#### Panel Layout

The split-panel layout can be adjusted by dragging the resize handles. Use the **›** button on the right-panel handle to expand/collapse the right panel.

---

### Interface Inheritance

A sub-component can declare that one of its interfaces **inherits** a parent component's interface. This means the sub-component's interface shares the same contract (functions and types) as the parent interface, sourced live from the parent rather than duplicated. Inheritance is **transitive**: if the parent interface is itself inherited, the child sees the parent's full effective inherited contract as read-only inherited functions.

#### Setting up inheritance

1. Select a sub-component in the tree.
2. If its parent component defines interfaces, an **"Inherit parent interface:"** selector appears above the interface tabs.
3. The dropdown lists all parent interfaces not yet inherited by this component. Select one to create a new inherited interface entry and activate its tab.
4. If the component already has an interface with the same ID, Integra analyzes the existing child-local functions before inheriting:
   - exact matches with the inherited contract are dropped as redundant
   - non-matching functions are kept as additional child-local functions
   - incompatible functions block inheritance and are shown in an error prompt
5. When there are no blocking conflicts, the user is prompted to confirm merging into the existing same-ID interface; cancelling leaves the existing interface unchanged.

#### Inherited interface behaviour

- The inherited interface tab is a **mixed view**:
  - parent-inherited functions stay read-only
  - child-added functions on the inherited interface are editable and removable
- Component and root class diagrams use the inherited interface's **effective contract**, which combines the full inherited-chain parent contract with any child-local additions.
- A badge shows which parent interface is being inherited (e.g. `inherited from IPaymentGateway`).
- To remove the inheritance, click the **delete** button on the inherited interface tab.
- Sequence diagrams **can add new child-local functions** to an inherited interface. If a message references a function that is not already defined on the parent interface, the function is stored locally on the child inherited interface instead of raising a parse error.
- If a child-added function is edited so it becomes identical to an inherited parent function, the user is prompted to confirm removing the redundant child-local function. If they cancel, the change is rejected.
- If a parent interface function change would become identical to child-added functions on inherited child interfaces, the user is prompted to confirm removing those child-local child functions. If they cancel, the parent change is rejected.

#### Warning icon

When a parent component's interface has no sub-component inheriting it, a **⚠** warning icon appears on the interface tab with the tooltip *"No sub-component inherits this interface"*. This is purely informational — it highlights interfaces that may be intended for inheritance but haven't been wired up yet.

### Diagram Specifications

#### Use Case Diagram

Declare actors, use cases, and their relationships.

```
# Local nodes (created in the owning component)
actor customer
use case login
use case placeOrder

# External node — reference an existing node by path
component root/admin as admin

# Relationships
customer ->> login
customer ->> placeOrder
admin ->> placeOrder
```

| Syntax | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `actor id` | Declare a local actor |
| `actor id as alias` | Declare a local actor; use `alias` in relationship lines |
| `use case id` | Declare a use case |
| `component path/to/node` | Reference an existing component by path (no new node created) |
| `component path/to/node as alias` | Reference with an alias |
| `A ->> B` | Relationship arrow (default — maps to `-->` in Mermaid) |
| `A ->> B: label` | Relationship arrow with a link label |

**Arrow types** — the arrow between two nodes maps directly to Mermaid flowchart syntax:

| Arrow | Mermaid meaning |
|---|---|
| `->>` | Arrowhead (**default**, backward-compatible — renders as `-->`) |
| `-->` | Arrowhead |
| `---` | Open link, no arrowhead |
| `--o` | Circle at end |
| `--x` | Cross/X at end |
| `<-->` | Bidirectional arrow |
| `o--o` | Bidirectional circle |
| `x--x` | Bidirectional cross |
| `-.->` | Dotted arrow |
| `-.-` | Dotted open link |
| `==>` | Thick arrow |
| `===` | Thick open link |
| `~~~` | Invisible link |

**Link labels** — append `: label text` to add a label displayed on the link:

```
customer ->> login: initiates
admin --o placeOrder: extends
customer <--> admin: interacts with
```

**Node IDs are scoped to the owning component.** The same ID can be reused in different components.

---

#### Sequence Diagram

Declare participants and message interactions.

```
# Local participants
actor customer
component orderSvc
component paymentSvc

# External component referenced by path
component root/services/auth as auth

customer ->> orderSvc: OrdersAPI:placeOrder(orderId: string, amount: number)
orderSvc ->> paymentSvc: PaymentsAPI:charge(orderId: string, amount: number, currency: string?)
orderSvc ->> customer: UseCase:orderConfirmed
orderSvc ->> customer: UseCase:orderService/orderConfirmed
orderSvc ->> customer: UseCase:root/orders/orderConfirmed:Order confirmed
orderSvc ->> customer: UseCaseDiagram:orderingFlows
orderSvc ->> customer: UseCaseDiagram:root/orders/orderingFlows:Ordering flows
orderSvc ->> customer: Sequence:orderConfirmedFlow
orderSvc ->> customer: Sequence:auth/loginFlow:Log In

note right of customer: initiates the flow
note over orderSvc, paymentSvc: payment handshake
```

| Syntax | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `# comment text` | Line comment — ignored by the parser; preserved through ID rename |
| `actor id` | Declare a local actor participant |
| `actor id as alias` | Declare a local actor; use `alias` in message lines |
| `component id` | Declare a local component participant |
| `component path/to/node` | Reference an existing component by path (no new node created) |
| `component path/to/node as alias` | Reference with an alias |
| `sender ->> receiver: Interface:function(param: type)` | Function call message — derives interface on receiver |
| `sender ->> receiver: Interface:function(param: type):display label` | Function call message with a custom display label (diagram shows only the label) |
| `sender ->> receiver: label text` | Plain message label |
| `sender ->> receiver` | Bare arrow (no label) |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCase:useCaseId` | Use case reference (local — receiver's component) |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCase:comp/useCaseId` | Use case reference by path (relative or absolute) |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCase:useCaseId:label` | Use case reference with a custom display label |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCase:comp/useCaseId:label` | Use case path reference with a custom label |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCaseDiagram:diagramId` | Use case diagram reference (expands to all sequence diagrams under its use cases) |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCaseDiagram:comp/diagramId` | Use case diagram reference by path |
| `sender ->> receiver: UseCaseDiagram:diagramId:label` | Use case diagram reference with a custom display label |
| `sender ->> receiver: Sequence:seqDiagramId` | Sequence diagram reference (local — receiver's component) |
| `sender ->> receiver: Sequence:comp/seqDiagramId` | Sequence diagram reference by path |
| `sender ->> receiver: Sequence:seqDiagramId:label` | Sequence diagram reference with a custom display label |
| `note right of id: text` | Note to the right of a participant |
| `note left of id: text` | Note to the left of a participant |
| `note over id: text` | Note spanning a single participant |
| `note over id1, id2: text` | Note spanning two participants |
| `loop [condition]` … `end` | Loop block (renders as Mermaid `loop`) |
| `alt [condition]` … `else [condition]` … `end` | Conditional block (renders as Mermaid `alt`/`else`) |
| `opt [condition]` … `end` | Optional block — single section, no `else` (renders as Mermaid `opt`) |
| `par [label]` … `and [label]` … `end` | Parallel block (renders as Mermaid `par`/`and`) |

**Arrow types** — the arrow between sender and receiver maps 1:1 to Mermaid's sequence diagram arrow syntax:

| Arrow | Mermaid meaning |
|---|---|
| `->>` | Solid line, arrowhead — synchronous call (**default**) |
| `-->>` | Dotted line, arrowhead — reply or async |
| `->` | Solid line, no arrowhead |
| `-->` | Dotted line, no arrowhead |
| `-x` | Solid line, X — destroy |
| `--x` | Dotted line, X |
| `-)` | Solid line, open arrowhead — async notation |
| `--)` | Dotted line, open arrowhead |

Prefix any sequence-diagram arrow with `X` (for example, `X->>` or `X-->`) to
exclude that message from **class-diagram dependency derivation** while still
rendering the underlying Mermaid arrow normally in the sequence diagram.

Example:
```
client ->> server: REST:getUser(id: string)
server -->> client: response
```

**Block constructs** — `loop`, `alt`, `opt`, and `par` wrap sequences of messages. Condition/label text after the keyword is optional free-form text. Blocks are fully nestable.

```
loop check every second
  A ->> B: ping
end

alt happy path
  A ->> B: ok
else error path
  A ->> B: err
else
  A ->> B: default
end

opt if user is premium
  A ->> B: upgrade offer
end

par send notification
  A ->> B: notify
and update audit log
  A ->> C: log
end
```

- `else` sections apply only to `alt` blocks; `and` sections apply only to `par` blocks; `opt` has no sections.
- `end`, `else`, `and`, and `opt` are reserved keywords and cannot be used as participant IDs.
- `UseCase:`, `UseCaseDiagram:`, and `Sequence:` path targets are not scope-restricted today. Only component path references follow the component-scope rules.

**Function call message format:** `sender ->> receiver: InterfaceId:functionId(param: type, param2: type?)`
- Parameter types default to `any` if omitted
- Append `?` to mark a parameter as optional (e.g. `name: string?`)
- Append `:display label` after the closing `)` to show a custom label in the diagram instead of `Interface:function(params)` (e.g. `IAuth:login(user: string):sign in`)
- For `kafka`-type interfaces, the **sender** owns the interface
- Use `\n` in a label or note text for a line break (renders as `<br/>` in Mermaid)

**Round-trip fidelity:** When a participant ID is renamed (e.g. via the rename action in the tree), the spec is re-generated from the AST. Line indentation (leading spaces and tabs inside blocks) and `#` comment lines are stored in the AST and reproduced verbatim — the only normalisation is that blank lines between statements are not preserved.

**Multi-word participant names** are supported — declare as `actor Output Topics` and reference the same name in messages.

**Self-reference:** A `component` participant with the same ID as the owning component is treated as a self-reference — no child component is created.

---

### Cross-Component References

Use a path to reference nodes defined in other parts of the tree. The path is a `/`-separated list of component IDs ending with the node ID:

```
# In a use case diagram — reference external component
component root/services/auth as auth

# In a sequence diagram — reference external component with alias
component root/services/payments as pay
customer ->> auth: AuthAPI:login(user: string)
customer ->> pay: PaymentsAPI:charge(amount: number)
```

When a path reference is used:
- If the terminal node does not yet exist it is **auto-created** (as a component), provided the path is in scope — intermediate missing components are also created automatically
- The node's UUID is recorded in `referencedNodeIds`; the node cannot be deleted while this reference exists
- The alias (if provided with `as alias`) is used in all message lines; otherwise the last path segment is used

**Single-segment declarations** (`actor id`, `component id`) always create or reference a **local** node within the owning component. Use a multi-segment path (`component root/services/auth`) to reach nodes elsewhere in the tree.

#### Reference scope

Multi-segment path references are restricted to components that are **in scope** for the owning diagram. A component `X` is in scope when it is:

| Relationship to ownerComp | Example (ownerComp = `child`) | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| **Self** | `child` | ✅ |
| **Direct child** | `child/grandchild` | ✅ |
| **Ancestor** (parent, grandparent, …) | `root` | ✅ |
| **Sibling** (direct child of parent) | `root/sibling` | ✅ |
| **Uncle/Aunt** (direct child of grandparent) | `root/grandparent/uncle` — resolved as `uncle` | ✅ |
| **Any descendant** (grandchild, great-grandchild, …) | `grandchild`, `grandchild/greatGrandchild` | ✅ |
| **Cousin** (child of sibling/uncle) | `root/sibling/cousin` | ❌ |

```
root
  child     ← ownerComp
    grandchild        # descendant of owner — ✅
      greatGrandchild # descendant of owner — ✅
  sibling             # direct child of ancestor root — ✅
    cousin            # child of sibling — ❌
```

Referencing an out-of-scope path causes a parse error and the diagram spec is not applied.

For sequence diagrams, these scope rules apply to **component references** (for example, multi-segment participant declarations such as `component root/service/db`).

Message labels that use `UseCase:...`, `UseCaseDiagram:...`, or `Sequence:...` do **not** have scope restrictions today. Their scoping logic is intentionally encapsulated in code so rules can be added later without rewiring all call sites.

---

### Markdown Descriptions

All description fields support Markdown. In preview mode, write links to other nodes using their tree path:

```markdown
See also [Login Flow](loginFlow)                          <!-- same component, bare id -->
See also [Auth Service](services/auth)                    <!-- cross-component path -->
See also [Login Use Case](services/auth/mainDiag/login)   <!-- deep path -->
```

Clicking a node link navigates to that node in the tree.

---

### YAML File Format

Integra saves and loads your model as a **directory of YAML files** — one file per component. The directory can be read, authored, or version-controlled by hand.

#### Directory layout

When you save a system whose root component has id `my-system`, you get:

```
my-system.yaml              ← root component (the load/save entry point)
my-system/
  my-system-gateway.yaml    ← direct child of root (parent-id: my-system)
  gateway-auth.yaml         ← child of gateway (parent-id: gateway)
  gateway-payments.yaml     ← another child of gateway
```

- The **root file** is `<root-id>.yaml` in the chosen directory.
- **Descendant files** live in a flat `<root-id>/` subdirectory named `<parent-id>-<self-id>.yaml`.
- The `subComponents` field in each file lists the **relative paths** of its children (relative to the chosen directory root), instead of inlining the child data.

#### Top-level structure

Each component YAML file has the following shape:

```yaml
uuid: <globally-unique-id>
id: my-system               # must be "root" for the root component
name: My System
type: component
description: Optional description   # supports Markdown
subComponents:
  - my-system/my-system-gateway.yaml   # relative path to child file
actors: [...]
useCaseDiagrams: [...]
interfaces: [...]
```

#### Node type fields

| Node type | Key fields (beyond `uuid`, `id`, `name`, `type`, `description`) |
|---|---|
| `component` | `subComponents[]` (file paths), `actors[]`, `useCaseDiagrams[]`, `interfaces[]` |
| `actor` | *(none)* |
| `use-case-diagram` | `content` (spec text), `useCases[]` |
| `use-case` | `sequenceDiagrams[]` |
| `sequence-diagram` | `content` (spec text) |

> All diagram types (`use-case-diagram` and `sequence-diagram`) support the `description` field.

Interface specifications live directly on their owning component:

| Object | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `InterfaceSpecification` | `uuid`, `id`, `name`, `type` (`rest`\|`kafka`\|`graphql`\|`other`), `functions[]` |
| `InterfaceFunction` | `uuid`, `id`, `description?`, `parameters[]` |
| `Parameter` | `name`, `type`, `required` (boolean), `description?` |

#### Example

Root file — `e-commerce.yaml`:

```yaml
uuid: a1b2c3d4-0001
id: e-commerce
name: E-Commerce System
type: component
subComponents:
  - e-commerce/e-commerce-orderSvc.yaml
actors:
  - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0020
    id: customer
    name: Customer
    type: actor
useCaseDiagrams:
  - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0030
    id: mainFlows
    name: Main Flows
    type: use-case-diagram
    content: |
      actor customer
      use case placeOrder
      customer ->> placeOrder
    useCases:
      - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0031
        id: placeOrder
        name: Place Order
        type: use-case
        sequenceDiagrams:
          - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0040
            id: placeOrderFlow
            name: Place Order Flow
            type: sequence-diagram
            content: |
              actor customer
              component orderSvc
              customer ->> orderSvc: OrdersAPI:placeOrder(orderId: string, amount: number)
interfaces: []
```

Child file — `e-commerce/e-commerce-orderSvc.yaml`:

```yaml
uuid: a1b2c3d4-0010
id: orderSvc
name: Order Service
type: component
subComponents: []
actors: []
useCaseDiagrams: []
interfaces:
  - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0011
    id: OrdersAPI
    name: OrdersAPI
    type: rest
    functions:
      - uuid: a1b2c3d4-0012
        id: placeOrder
        parameters:
          - name: orderId
            type: string
            required: true
          - name: amount
            type: number
            required: true
```

The only field you must ensure is unique is `uuid` — use any distinct string per node (e.g. standard UUIDs or simple incrementing IDs as in the example above).

## For Developers

### System Requirements

Integra is a single-page web application that allows users to model software systems hierarchically. The core requirements are:

1. **Hierarchical component model** — a tree of components, each with actors, sub-components, use case diagrams, and interface specifications
2. **Use case diagrams** — text-specified diagrams that declare actors and use cases, with relationship arrows rendered via Mermaid
3. **Sequence diagrams** — text-specified interaction diagrams that automatically derive typed interface specifications on components
4. **Derived interfaces** — interface functions (with typed parameters) are extracted from sequence diagram messages and stored on the receiving component
5. **Cross-component references** — participants can reference nodes in other components by path; if the target node does not exist it is auto-created (including intermediate missing components); referenced nodes cannot be deleted while the reference exists
6. **Self-referencing** — a sequence diagram can declare a participant with the same id as its owning component (treated as a self-reference, not a new child)
7. **Use case references in messages** — sequence diagram messages can reference use cases via `UseCase:ucId` (local) or `UseCase:path/to/comp/ucId` (cross-component); referenced use cases cannot be deleted
8. **Block constructs** — sequence diagrams support `loop`, `alt`/`else`, `opt`, and `par`/`and` structural blocks (fully nestable); interface specs are derived from messages at any nesting depth
9. **Function update flow** — when a function signature changes, the user is prompted to update all affected sequence diagrams or add an overload
9. **Orphan detection** — actors and components not referenced by any diagram are deletable; otherwise the delete button is hidden
10. **Syntax highlighting** — the diagram specification editor (CodeMirror 6) highlights known tokens (keywords, participants, interfaces, functions, use case references) in real time using a Chevrotain-based decoration pass
11. **Navigation** — highlighted tokens in the specification editor are clickable and navigate to the corresponding node in the tree; entities in the rendered Mermaid diagram are also clickable for the same purpose
12. **Persistence** — system state is persisted to `localStorage` and restored on page load; a clear button resets to the initial state; Save / Load buttons use the File System Access API to read/write YAML files
13. **Auto-generated use-case class diagram** — selecting a use-case node renders a class diagram in the bottom panel derived from all its sequence diagrams plus transitively referenced `Sequence:` and `UseCase:` targets, showing actors, components, interfaces (with methods), and realization / dependency relationships; repeated reachable diagrams are deduplicated and circular references are ignored after the first visit. Messages whose arrows are prefixed with `X` are skipped when deriving dependencies
14. **Auto-generated component class diagram** — selecting a component node renders a class diagram showing: the component's own interfaces (with method signatures, filtered to only the methods actually called in diagrams when those interfaces participate in derived dependencies); sibling actors/components that call those interfaces (dependents); sibling components that this component calls out to (dependencies); and dependency interfaces derived from nested calls without rendering the selected component's own sub-components as separate classes; with distinct colors for the subject component and its own interfaces; when the root component is selected, shows direct root children, participating root actors, and relationships between them, including dependencies rolled up from nested descendants. Dependency derivation follows transitively referenced `Sequence:` and `UseCase:` targets with deduplication and cycle protection, and ignores messages whose arrows are prefixed with `X`

### Design Overview

#### Model Invariants

The core model is intentionally split between a **stored write model** and a
**resolved read model**. Contributors should preserve that split by using the
shared helpers below instead of reaching into nested fields directly.

| Invariant | What it means | Use these helpers |
|---|---|---|
| Inherited interfaces resolve their contract from the full inherited chain + child-local additions | An inherited `InterfaceSpecification` stores child-local added functions in `functions`, while read paths resolve the effective contract by recursively following inherited parent interfaces and merging that result with the local additions | `isInheritedInterface()`, `isLocalInterface()`, `getStoredInterfaceFunctions()`, `resolveEffectiveInterfaceFunctions()`, `resolveInterface()` in `src/utils/interfaceFunctions.ts` |
| Components are updated immutably and kept in canonical order | Updates should return new objects, not mutate nested arrays, and interface/function ordering should stay normalized | `normalizeComponent()`, `normalizeComponentDeep()`, `addFunctionToInterface()`, `updateFunctionParams()`, `removeFunctionsFromInterfaces()` in `src/nodes/interfaceOps.ts` |
| Parent functions remain authoritative while child-local inherited functions are additive | Child-added functions may exist on inherited interfaces, but exact duplicates with the parent must be removed explicitly through the conflict-resolution flow | `findInheritedParentFunction()`, `findConflictingInheritedChildFunctions()`, the parser/update flow in `src/parser/sequenceDiagram/systemUpdater.ts`, and `applyFunctionUpdates()` |
| Reparsing sequence diagrams must preserve user-authored metadata | Rebuilding functions from diagram text should keep descriptions and parameter metadata where possible | `tryReparseContent()` in `src/store/systemOps.ts` |
| Runtime boundaries validate and normalize model data before it enters the app state | Persisted YAML / `localStorage` data should be parsed through the schema layer, not trusted as-is | `parseComponentNode()`, `safeParseComponentNode()`, `safeParsePersistedSystemState()` in `src/store/modelSchema.ts` |
| Cross-component references must stay within the supported scope rules | Diagram references are only valid for the owning component, its descendants, its ancestors, and direct children of those ancestors | `isInScope()` in `src/utils/nodeUtils.ts` |

#### Which helper should I use?

- **Reading interface functions for rendering, lookup, or validation:** use
  `resolveEffectiveInterfaceFunctions()` or `resolveInterface()`. Do **not**
  assume `iface.functions` is the readable contract for inherited interfaces.
- **Reading only locally stored functions during an edit operation:** use
  `getStoredInterfaceFunctions()`. For inherited interfaces, this returns the
  child-local additions rather than the full effective contract.
- **Adding/removing/updating functions on a component:** use the helpers in
  `src/nodes/interfaceOps.ts`, then normalize with `normalizeComponent()`
  where appropriate instead of mutating `component.interfaces` in place.
- **Reparsing diagram text back into the model tree:** use
  `tryReparseContent()` so function descriptions and parameter metadata are
  preserved across parser rebuilds.
- **Accepting data from persistence or imports:** go through
  `safeParsePersistedSystemState()` / `parseComponentNode()` instead of casting
  unknown data to the model types.
- **Checking whether a diagram may reference another component:** use
  `isInScope()` rather than hand-rolling ancestor/sibling checks.

#### Examples

**Read the effective contract for inherited interfaces**

```ts
// Bad: inherited interfaces may store only child-local additions
const functions = iface.functions

// Good: resolve the readable contract from the inherited chain plus child-local additions
const functions = resolveEffectiveInterfaceFunctions(iface, ownerComp, rootComponent)
```

**Detect redundant inherited child-local functions**

```ts
const inheritedParentFn = findInheritedParentFunction(
  currentInterface,
  ownerComponent,
  rootComponent,
  functionId,
  newParams,
)

if (inheritedParentFn) {
  // Prompt the user to remove the redundant child-local function,
  // or reject the change if they cancel.
}
```

**Preserve immutability and canonical ordering**

```ts
// Bad: mutates nested state and bypasses sorting rules
component.interfaces.push(newInterface)

// Good: return a new component value and normalize its ordering
const next = normalizeComponent({
  ...component,
  interfaces: [...component.interfaces, newInterface],
})
```

**Preserve user-authored metadata when reparsing sequence diagrams**

```ts
const result = tryReparseContent(content, system, nodeUuid)
if (!result.parseError) {
  updateSystem(result.rootComponent)
}
```

When in doubt, prefer the shared helper that already exists in the store,
parser, or node utility layer. Most of the subtle model bugs in this codebase
come from bypassing one of these invariants.

#### React Component Architecture

The UI is split into three panels managed by `MainLayout`. Each panel is independently scrollable and resizable via drag handles.

```mermaid
graph TD
    App --> MainLayout

    MainLayout -->|left panel| TreeView
    MainLayout -->|right panel| EditorPanel
    MainLayout -->|bottom panel| DiagramPanel

    TreeView --> TreeNode["TreeNode (recursive)"]
    TreeNode --> ContextMenu

    EditorPanel -->|component| ComponentEditor
    EditorPanel -->|"use-case-diagram<br>sequence-diagram"| DiagramEditor
    EditorPanel -->|actor, use-case, etc.| CommonEditor

    ComponentEditor --> InterfaceEditor
    ComponentEditor --> MarkdownEditor
    InterfaceEditor --> FunctionEditor
    FunctionEditor --> MarkdownEditor
    CommonEditor --> MarkdownEditor

    DiagramEditor --> DiagramCodeMirrorEditor
    DiagramEditor --> FunctionUpdateDialog

    DiagramPanel -->|use-case-diagram default| UseCaseDiagram
    DiagramPanel -->|use-case-diagram alternate| UseCaseDiagramClassDiagram
    DiagramPanel -->|sequence-diagram| SequenceDiagram
    DiagramPanel -->|use-case| UseCaseClassDiagram
    DiagramPanel -->|component| ComponentClassDiagram
```

**Panel roles:**

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `MainLayout` | Split-panel layout with draggable resize handles and expand/collapse buttons |
| `TreeView` | System tree with add/delete/rename; Save, Load, Clear, Undo/Redo toolbar; Integra app icon in header |
| `TreeNode` | Recursive node row — renders label, type icon, +/delete buttons, selection highlight |
| `ContextMenu` | Right-click menu for node-level actions |
| `EditorPanel` | Routes to the correct editor based on the selected node's type |
| `DiagramEditor` | Text editor for use-case and sequence diagram specs; syntax highlighting, autocomplete, undo/redo, Shift+Enter save |
| `DiagramCodeMirrorEditor` | CodeMirror 6 editor wrapper used by `DiagramEditor`; handles both editable and read-only (preview) modes; Chevrotain-powered syntax highlighting; click-to-navigate tokens in preview mode |
| `ComponentEditor` | Name, description, and interface list editor for component nodes; "Inherit parent interface" selector above tabs for sub-components |
| `InterfaceEditor` | Interface name, type, and function list editor |
| `FunctionEditor` | Function id, parameters, and description editor; shows referencing sequence diagrams |
| `CommonEditor` | Minimal name + markdown description editor for actor, use-case, and sequence-diagram nodes |
| `MarkdownEditor` | Markdown textarea with preview toggle; node-path links are clickable |
| `FunctionUpdateDialog` | Modal dialog shown when a function signature change affects other diagrams |
| `DiagramPanel` | Routes to the correct visualization view based on the selected node type and active panel view |
| `UseCaseDiagram` | Renders use-case-diagram spec via Mermaid; clickable entities |
| `UseCaseDiagramClassDiagram` | Renders the generated class diagram for a use-case-diagram node by aggregating all child use cases |
| `SequenceDiagram` | Renders sequence diagram spec via Mermaid; clickable participants and message labels |
| `UseCaseClassDiagram` | Renders auto-generated class diagram for a use-case node; clickable classes |
| `ComponentClassDiagram` | Renders auto-generated class diagram for a component node showing its interfaces and dependents (callers) and dependencies (outgoing calls to other components); clickable classes |
| `DiagramErrorBanner` | Displays Mermaid render errors with the raw spec source |

#### Hooks

Rendering logic for Mermaid diagrams is extracted into custom hooks to keep components thin:

| Hook | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `useMermaidBase` | `useUseCaseDiagram`, `useSequenceDiagram` | Shared Mermaid render loop — builds the diagram string, calls `mermaid.render()`, binds click handlers, exposes `svg`/`error`/`elementRef` |
| `useUseCaseDiagram` | `UseCaseDiagram` | Builds the use-case diagram transform and wires `__integraNavigate` |
| `useSequenceDiagram` | `SequenceDiagram` | Builds the sequence diagram transform and wires `__integraNavigate` |
| `useMermaidClassDiagram<T>` | `useUseCaseClassDiagram`, `useUseCaseDiagramClassDiagram`, `useComponentClassDiagram` | Generic shared hook — accepts a `buildFn(node, rootComponent)` and an `idPrefix`; handles Mermaid render, click binding, error state, and the per-instance `idToUuidRef` (eliminates the `__integraIdMap` global) |
| `useUseCaseClassDiagram` | `UseCaseClassDiagram` | Thin wrapper: calls `useMermaidClassDiagram(buildUseCaseClassDiagram, node, "uc-class")` |
| `useUseCaseDiagramClassDiagram` | `UseCaseDiagramClassDiagram` | Thin wrapper: calls `useMermaidClassDiagram(buildUseCaseDiagramClassDiagram, node, "uc-diagram-class")` |
| `useComponentClassDiagram` | `ComponentClassDiagram` | Thin wrapper: calls `useMermaidClassDiagram(buildComponentClassDiagram, node, "comp-class")` |
| `useAutoComplete` | `DiagramEditor` / `integraAutocomplete.ts` | Thin React hook — wires cursor position to suggestion results; pure logic (`detectContext`, `buildSuggestions`, etc.) lives in `autoCompleteLogic.ts` |

#### State Management

All application state lives in a single **Zustand** store (`useSystemStore`). Components subscribe selectively to avoid unnecessary re-renders. The store is composed from four slice files:

```
src/store/
  useSystemStore.ts         ← composes slices + persist middleware (~60 lines)
  systemOps.ts              ← pure helpers: rebuildSystemDiagrams, tryReparseContent,
                               stripExclusiveFunctionContributions (independently testable)
  slices/
    historySlice.ts         ← past, future, undo, redo
    uiSlice.ts              ← selectedNodeId, parseError, savedSnapshot, selectNode, markSaved
    nodeOpsSlice.ts         ← addNode, updateNode, deleteNode, renameNodeId
    diagramSlice.ts         ← setSystem, clearSystem, applyFunctionUpdates
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    Store[("useSystemStore<br>Zustand + persist<br>(composed from slices)")]

    Store -->|"rootComponent<br>selectedNodeId"| TreeView
    Store -->|"rootComponent<br>selectedNodeId"| EditorPanel
    Store -->|"rootComponent<br>selectedNodeId"| MainLayout
    Store -->|"rootComponent<br>selectedNodeId"| DiagramPanel

    TreeView -->|"selectNode<br>updateNode<br>addNode<br>deleteNode<br>undo / redo<br>markSaved<br>setSystem"| Store
    EditorPanel -->|"updateNode<br>applyFunctionUpdates"| Store
    DiagramPanel -->|selectNode| Store
```

Key state fields:

| Field | Type | Slice | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rootComponent` | `ComponentNode` | top-level | Entire system tree |
| `selectedNodeId` | `string \| null` | `uiSlice` | Currently selected node UUID |
| `savedSnapshot` | `string \| null` | `uiSlice` | YAML snapshot at last save (for unsaved-changes detection) |
| `past` / `future` | `ComponentNode[]` | `historySlice` | Undo/redo history stacks |

#### Node Types

| Type | Parent | Auto-created? | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| `component` | `component` | Yes (from seq diagram) | actors, subComponents, useCaseDiagrams, interfaces |
| `actor` | `component` | Yes (from diagrams) | — |
| `use-case-diagram` | `component` | No | useCases |
| `use-case` | `use-case-diagram` | Yes (from UC diagram) | sequenceDiagrams |
| `sequence-diagram` | `use-case` | No | — |

#### Auto-generated Use-Case Class Diagram

When a `use-case` node is selected, `buildUseCaseClassDiagram()` (`src/utils/useCaseClassDiagram.ts`) builds the same shared class-diagram graph used by the other generated class-diagram views:

- Starts from the use case's own sequence diagrams, then follows referenced `Sequence:` and `UseCase:` targets transitively with deduplication and cycle protection
- Uses the owning component as the visibility boundary
- Shows only in-scope components plus the interfaces owned by those visible components
- Folds dependencies from out-of-scope descendants to the closest visible ancestor
- Supports the shared `Interfaces` toggle plus single-click focus / double-click navigation behavior

#### Auto-generated Component Class Diagram

When a `component` node is selected, `buildComponentClassDiagram()` (`src/utils/componentClassDiagram.ts`) uses that component as both the owner boundary and the default highlighted subject:

- Starts from sequence diagrams owned under the selected component (or the full system when the selected component is the root), then follows referenced diagrams transitively
- Shows the selected component itself plus any visible in-scope actors, components, and dependency-participating interfaces
- Highlights the selected component and its interfaces by default
- Folds deeper descendants to their closest visible direct child / in-scope ancestor component
- Reuses the same interface toggle, focus filter, and double-click navigation model as the other generated class diagrams

The **visible-participant restriction** is the key scoping rule: the diagram stays at one visible level at a time. It shows the subject, its direct siblings, and—when nested activity needs to be surfaced—rolled-up direct children of the selected component. It does not expose arbitrary deep descendants of sibling or ancestor-sibling components.

Example output for `orderSvc` (provides `OrdersAPI`, called by `client`, depends on `paymentSvc.PaymentsAPI`):
```
classDiagram
    class orderSvc["Order Service"]
    class OrdersAPI {
        <<interface>>
        +placeOrder(orderId: string, amount: number)
    }
    orderSvc ..|> OrdersAPI
    class client["Client"]
    client ..> OrdersAPI
    class PaymentsAPI {
        <<interface>>
        +charge(orderId: string, amount: number)
    }
    class paymentSvc["Payment Service"]
    paymentSvc ..|> PaymentsAPI
    orderSvc ..> PaymentsAPI
    click orderSvc call __integraNavigate("orderSvc")
    click client call __integraNavigate("client")
    click paymentSvc call __integraNavigate("paymentSvc")
    style orderSvc fill:#1d4ed8,stroke:#1e3a5f,color:#ffffff
    style OrdersAPI fill:#bfdbfe,stroke:#2563eb,color:#1e3a5f
```

#### Parsers (`src/parser/`)

Diagram specs are parsed by **Chevrotain**-based lexer + CstParser + CST visitor pipelines, one per diagram type:

```
src/parser/
  tokens.ts                     ← shared token definitions
  sequenceDiagram/
    lexer.ts                    ← multi-mode lexer; Indent token (line-start whitespace) and Comment token (# prefix)
    parser.ts                   ← CstParser
    visitor.ts                  ← CST → SeqAst { declarations[], statements[] }
                                   statement types carry optional `indent?: string`; SeqComment preserves # lines
    systemUpdater.ts            ← SeqAst → node tree update
    mermaidGenerator.ts         ← SeqAst → Mermaid string + idToUuid map (uses nodeTree, not store)
    specSerializer.ts           ← SeqAst → spec text; AST-aware ID rename; reproduces original indentation and comments
  useCaseDiagram/
    lexer.ts                    ← single-mode lexer
    parser.ts                   ← CstParser
    visitor.ts                  ← CST → UcdAst { declarations[], links[] }
    systemUpdater.ts            ← UcdAst → node tree update
    mermaidGenerator.ts         ← UcdAst → Mermaid string + idToUuid map (uses nodeTree, not store)
    specSerializer.ts           ← UcdAst → spec text; AST-aware ID rename
```

The `mermaidGenerator` files are pure (no store imports) — they accept a `root: ComponentNode` and produce a Mermaid string using `findNodeByUuid` from `src/nodes/nodeTree` directly.

#### Node Tree (`src/nodes/`)

The component tree is managed through a typed dispatch layer:

```
src/nodes/
  nodeTree.ts             ← generic tree ops (upsert, delete, find, collect) via NodeHandler dispatch
  nodeHandler.ts          ← NodeHandler interface
  componentNode.ts        ← componentHandler + re-exports from split modules
  componentCRUD.ts        ← component/actor factory and structural mutation helpers
  componentTraversal.ts   ← read-only search: findCompByUuid, findParent, getSiblingIds, etc.
  interfaceOps.ts         ← interface/function mutations: addFunction, updateParams, removeFunctions
  useCaseDiagramNode.ts   ← ucDiagHandler
  useCaseNode.ts          ← useCaseHandler
  sequenceDiagramNode.ts  ← leaf handler + replaceSignatureInContent
  actorNode.ts            ← leaf handler
```

`nodeHandlers: Record<Node["type"], NodeHandler>` enforces exhaustiveness at compile time — adding a new node type without registering a handler is a TypeScript error.

`SeqAst.statements` preserves source order for both messages and notes, so notes appear in the rendered diagram exactly where they were written.

**Node ID renaming** uses an AST-aware parse → rename → serialize round-trip (`specSerializer.ts`) rather than regex replacement. This correctly handles IDs that contain hyphens (e.g. `api-gateway`) which a word-boundary regex would corrupt.

**Parsed-AST caching**: `src/utils/seqAstCache.ts` provides a module-level `Map<content, SeqAst>` cache used by the class diagram builders. The same sequence diagram content is never re-parsed more than once per session, avoiding redundant Chevrotain full-parses on every React render.

- `ownerComponentUuid` — the component that logically owns the diagram (set when created)
- `referencedNodeIds` — UUIDs of all actors/components/use-cases referenced in the diagram spec
- `referencedFunctionUuids` — UUIDs of all interface functions referenced in the diagram spec

#### Data Flow

```
User types spec
     │
     ▼
updateNode(diagramUuid, { content })
     │
     ├─► parseUseCaseDiagram()    (for use-case-diagram)
     │         └─► upsertTree() — adds actors, use cases to owning component
     │
     └─► parseSequenceDiagram()   (for sequence-diagram)
               ├─► applyParticipantsToComponent() — adds actors/components
               ├─► applyMessageToComponents() — derives interface functions
               └─► upsertTree() — stores referencedNodeIds, referencedFunctionUuids
```

Both parsers are implemented with **Chevrotain** (lexer + CstParser + CST visitor), producing typed ASTs (`SeqAst` / `UcdAst`) before applying node-tree changes or generating Mermaid output. Parse errors are reported with line and column numbers and cleared automatically when the content becomes valid.

#### Interface Derivation

Each `sender ->> receiver: InterfaceId:functionId(...)` message:
1. Finds or creates an `InterfaceSpecification` with `id = InterfaceId` on the receiver (or sender for `kafka`)
2. Finds or creates a function with `id = functionId` and the parsed parameter list
3. If a function with the same id already exists with a **different** parameter count or types, the user is prompted via a dialog to update all affected diagrams or add as overload
4. If the interface has `parentInterfaceUuid` set (**inherited interface**), exact parent matches continue using the inherited parent function, while new signatures are stored as child-local additions on the inherited interface
5. If a child-local inherited function becomes identical to the parent, or a parent change would become identical to child-local inherited functions, the user is prompted to confirm removing the redundant child-local functions; otherwise the change is rejected

#### Interface Inheritance (view-layer class)

Inheritance is stored as a single `parentInterfaceUuid?: string` field on `InterfaceSpecification`. Functions on an inherited interface store only the child-local additions; the effective readable contract is resolved by combining those stored functions with the parent's functions.

The `InheritedInterface` class (`src/components/editor/InheritedInterface.ts`) is a view-layer wrapper constructed at React render time only — never stored in Zustand or serialized:

```typescript
class InheritedInterface implements InterfaceSpecification {
  get functions() { return this.parentIface.functions }  // reads from parent
  set functions(_) {}  // no-op — prevents assignment errors from React internals
}
```

`ComponentEditor` wraps stored plain-object interfaces in `InheritedInterface` when `parentInterfaceUuid` is set, so all downstream components (`InterfaceEditor`, `FunctionEditor`) receive the parent's functions transparently. **The class is never spread, stringified, or stored** — Zustand state always holds plain objects.

#### Deletion Guards

- **Actors / components**: deletable only when `isNodeOrphaned()` returns `true` — i.e., the node's UUID appears in no `referencedNodeIds` anywhere in the full tree
- **Use cases**: deletable only when `isUseCaseReferenced()` returns `false` — same full-tree search
- `isNodeOrphaned` delegates to `isUseCaseReferenced` for a unified implementation

#### Syntax Highlighting (CodeMirror 6 + Chevrotain)

The spec editor uses **CodeMirror 6** (`DiagramCodeMirrorEditor`) for both editable and read-only preview modes.  Syntax colouring is provided by a CodeMirror `StateField<DecorationSet>` in `integraLanguage.ts` that runs line-by-line regex tokenisation (identical patterns to the former backdrop approach) on every document change and maps token types to `Decoration.mark({ class })` spans.  The same pass also builds a navigation map (offset range → node UUID) used by the readonly editor to navigate the tree on token click.

Chevrotain lexer tokens defined in `src/parser/tokens.ts` are the authoritative token vocabulary; the CM highlight field follows the same pattern rules to keep behaviour in sync.

Autocomplete is provided by `integraAutocomplete.ts`, a CodeMirror `CompletionSource` that delegates to the pure functions `detectContext` / `buildSuggestions` exported from `autoCompleteLogic.ts`. The React hook `useAutoComplete` is a thin wrapper that wires cursor position to those pure functions; `integraAutocomplete.ts` calls them directly without going through the hook. CodeMirror manages the trigger delay and dropdown UI.

#### Architecturally Significant Flows

The following sequence diagrams highlight the main runtime loops that make
Integra more than a static diagram editor. They focus on the paths where UI
actions trigger parsing, store reconciliation, reference maintenance, and
derived visualization generation.

##### 1. Function parameter change → conflict detection → propagated updates

This is the core "diagram text drives the model" flow for sequence diagrams.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant DiagramEditor
    participant Analyzer as analyzeSequenceDiagramChanges()
    participant Dialog as FunctionUpdateDialog
    participant Store as applyFunctionUpdates()
    participant Reparse as tryReparseContent()
    participant Parser as parseSequenceDiagram()

    User->>DiagramEditor: Edit function call signature in sequence spec
    DiagramEditor->>Analyzer: Analyze current content vs existing model
    Analyzer->>Analyzer: Parse DSL, flatten messages, compare params
    Analyzer-->>DiagramEditor: FunctionMatch[]

    alt Conflicts found
        DiagramEditor->>Dialog: Open conflict resolution dialog
        User->>Dialog: Choose add-new / update-existing / update-all
        Dialog->>Store: Submit FunctionDecision[]
        Store->>Store: Update interface functions and affected diagrams
        Store->>Reparse: Reparse saved sequence content
        Reparse->>Parser: Rebuild derived references and functions
        Parser-->>Store: Updated rootComponent + parseError=null
        Store-->>DiagramEditor: Publish reconciled Zustand state
    else No conflicts
        DiagramEditor->>Reparse: Save content directly through update flow
    end
```

- `DiagramEditor` calls `analyzeSequenceDiagramChanges()` before saving changed
  sequence content.
- If a signature change would affect referenced functions elsewhere, the editor
  pauses and opens `FunctionUpdateDialog` instead of silently mutating the
  model.
- `applyFunctionUpdates()` updates both interface definitions and any affected
  sequence-diagram text, then runs `tryReparseContent()` so the stored model and
  derived references stay aligned.

##### 2. Node rename / ID rename → scoped reference updates

This flow explains how Integra preserves reference integrity when IDs change.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Editor as Node editor
    participant Store as renameNodeId()
    participant Rename as applyIdRename()
    participant Scope as renameResolvedPathSegments()
    participant Rebuild as rebuildSystemDiagrams()

    User->>Editor: Rename actor / component / use case / diagram ID
    Editor->>Store: renameNodeId(uuid, newId)
    Store->>Store: Resolve oldId from current tree
    Store->>Rename: Apply deep rename across model
    Rename->>Scope: Rewrite only path segments that still resolve to target UUID
    Scope-->>Rename: Scoped path + markdown reference updates
    Rename-->>Store: Renamed component tree
    Store->>Rebuild: Re-parse diagrams and refresh derived references
    Rebuild-->>Store: Consistent rootComponent
    Store-->>Editor: Publish updated state to tree/editor/diagrams
```

- `renameNodeId()` does not perform a raw text replacement; it delegates to
  `applyIdRename()` and scoped path-resolution helpers so only references that
  still resolve to the renamed target are rewritten.
- Markdown node-path links and diagram-path references are updated together,
  which keeps descriptions and specs synchronized.
- `rebuildSystemDiagrams()` runs after the rename so `referencedNodeIds`,
  `referencedFunctionUuids`, and other derived fields reflect the new IDs.

##### 3. Generated class diagram flow for use-case, use-case-diagram, and component views

This is the runtime path from authored diagrams to derived visualizations in the
bottom panel.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Tree as TreeView
    participant Panel as DiagramPanel
    participant Views as VisualizationViewControls
    participant Hook as useMermaidClassDiagram()
    participant Builder as Class diagram builders
    participant Refs as collectReferencedSequenceDiagrams()
    participant Mermaid as mermaid.render()
    participant Canvas as ClassDiagramCanvas

    User->>Tree: Select component / use case / use-case-diagram
    Tree-->>Panel: selectedNodeId
    alt use-case-diagram alternate view
        User->>Views: Switch from Diagram to Class Diagram
        Views-->>Panel: activeVisualizationViewId
    end
    Panel->>Hook: Render selected visualization view
    Hook->>Builder: buildComponentClassDiagram() or buildUseCaseClassDiagram() or buildUseCaseDiagramClassDiagram()
    Builder->>Refs: Collect direct + transitive sequence diagrams
    Refs-->>Builder: Reachable sequence-diagram set
    Builder-->>Hook: Shared class-diagram graph + relationship metadata
    Hook->>Mermaid: Render SVG
    Mermaid-->>Canvas: SVG + click bindings
    Canvas-->>User: Pan/zoom, focus/filter, navigate, inspect dependency sources
```

- `DiagramPanel` now uses a generic per-node-type view model, so a node can
  expose more than one visualization without hard-coding new panel branches.
- `buildUseCaseDiagramClassDiagram()` reuses the same shared graph builder as
  the other generated class diagrams, but starts from all use cases under the
  selected use-case diagram.
- All generated class diagrams flow through `useMermaidClassDiagram()`, which
  centralizes Mermaid rendering, single-click focus filtering, double-click
  navigation, and relationship popup wiring.
- `DiagramPanel` owns the visualization-only `Interfaces` toggle state and
  passes it into the generated class-diagram hooks so the stored component and
  interface model stays unchanged.
